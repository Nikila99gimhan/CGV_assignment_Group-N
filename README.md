## Project Documentation: Sign Sheet Processing

### 1. Introduction

This documentation describes the process of extracting data from sign sheets. We utilize a combination of traditional computer vision techniques along with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to capture and record necessary details. 

### 2. Image Preprocessing

The steps include:

1. **Reading the Image**: The image is read from the `Samples` directory based on the filename provided as an argument.
   
2. **Image Scaling**: The image is resized to 40% of its original size for easier processing and speed optimization.
    
3. **Adaptive Binary Conversion**:
    - The image is converted to grayscale.
    - Gaussian Blur is applied for noise reduction.
    - Adaptive thresholding is used to obtain a binary image with the `cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C` method.

4. **Image Rotation and Cropping**:
    - External contours of the binary image are identified.
    - The largest contour, assumed to be the sign sheet, is isolated.
    - The image is rotated based on the orientation of the largest contour to ensure it's aligned correctly.
    - The image is further cropped to focus on the relevant sections.

### 3. Text Extraction and Signature Detection

1. **Text Extraction**:
    - Using the `easyocr` library, the program reads text data from the processed sections of the image. 
    - The OCR results are then cleaned, with certain character replacements (e.g., `$` replaced by `S`).
    
2. **Signature Detection**:
    - Each section of the image, assumed to represent a student, contains a subsection for the signature.
    - The white-space percentage in the signature area is computed.
    - Based on a threshold (5% in this code), it's determined whether a signature is present (attendance marked) or not.

### 4. Output

1. **Text Information**:
    - The extracted data (student index, name, and attendance) is structured and saved in XML format under the `Outputs` directory.
    
2. **Signature Saving**:
    - The detected signatures are saved as individual `.jpeg` images under the `Outputs` directory.
